> A static page to organize large scale itineraries for groups of people.

> This web app is dedicated to a special duo who have dubbed their romance as finding your adventure buddy for life.

> It started with 40-50 man cross-country snowboarding and festival trips. They then used their talented level of organization for their 150-person destination wedding without the hire of a wedding planner. Multiple apps have been used over the years to make sure participants are well informed of 'adventures' planned. This project was an answer to a call for a static, easy access website/app fit for all levels of internet navigators (and also those who prefer a more discreet internet presence).
